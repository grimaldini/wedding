                <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
                <p>We met through friends, the old school way, in San Francisco in September of 2014. We didn't speak much on our first encounter, but Luis kept coincidentally on purpose being at the same events as Marianne the rest of that weekend. Luis found out Marianne & her friends were going to Santa Cruz to learn how to surf, and offered to come down with his surf board and teach them.</p>
                <p>Luis is not a morning person, but at the crack of dawn that Sunday, he was there. Marianne thought he was fun, but the moment she became curious to actually get to know Luis was later at the restaurant when they were playing italian opera, and Luis mentioned "I love the Three Tenors." Marianne was instantly impressed, since not many people enjoy opera these days, and Marianne loves it! ... and the rest is history!</p>

                <h3>THE PROPOSAL</h3>
                <p>For their 5 year dating anniversary, Luis took Marianne on a trip to the Middle East in Nov of 2019. They saw enchanting sights in Istanbul, Egypt, and Jordan. Luis made a sketch of all the key landmarks along the way.</p>
                <p>A few days before the end of the trip, they visited the landmark Marianne was looking forward to the most: Petra! Luis and Marianne woke up before the sunrise and did the hike up to see The Monestary, one of the legendary monuments carved into the rock. Luis suggested to go up to the best viewpoint and take a picture. Luis then handed Marianne the journal he had been sketching in during the trip, and asked her to flip to the last page. Marianne opened it, and what she saw was a sketch of the Monestary, from the exact point where they were standing now. And in the sketch, Luis was down on one knee with a ring. Surprised, she looked up, and Luis was down on one knee just like the sketch, and asked her to marry him. The most amazing and biggest surprise in the world - and of course Marianne said yes! Or actually, "Yay!" because she was lost for words.</p>

                <h3>Getting there</h3>
                <p>We recommend flying into Mexico City Intl. Airport (MEX).</p>
                <p>The easiest, safest and most straightforward (and personally tested!) transport option we have found is through Pullman executive buses. These are high-end buses that leave directly from inside the AIRPORT TERMINAL (from both Terminal 1 and 2). They have Wi-Fi, AC and they even play a movie on the ride over!</p>
                <p>They run every hour or half hour depending on the time of day, and can be booked in person when you arrive at the airport, or online two weeks before at www.pullman.mx (we will be uploading a step by step booking guide in English if you want to do the online option, since we know the website is only available in Spanish ☺️). It's only $15 and the ride is about 1hr and 45min.</p>
                <p>The bus drop off is at the Cuernavaca Casino Station 10 minutes away from the hacienda. From the bus terminal, the easiest thing is to grab an UBER ride (~$2) or a taxi to the hacienda.</p>
                <p>If your flight lands after 8:30pm, we recommend staying at the <a target="_blank" class="getting-there-link" href="https://www.hilton.com/en/book/reservation/flexibledates/?ctyhocn=MEXAHHF&arrivalDate=2022-05-06&departureDate=2022-05-07&room1NumAdults=2&displayCurrency=USD">Hilton Hotel</a> inside the airport or <a target="_blank" class="getting-there-link" href="https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/mexico-city/mexai/hoteldetail">Holiday Inn Express</a> right outside the airport which provides a free shuttle from and to the airport and taking the bus the next morning from the airport just to be extra safe.</p>
                <p>We strongly recommend not to rent a car.</p>
                <p><b>Note: </b>Reminder to check your passport expiration dates now so that you have plenty of time to renew it if necessary.</p>
                <p>We are so excited for you guys to see this gorgeous venue! Please reach out if you have any questions whatsoever!</p>
